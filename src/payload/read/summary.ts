/**
 * The numbers on the admin landing page.
 *
 * Payload's default dashboard is a grid of cards, one per collection, all the
 * same size — it tells you the collections exist, which you knew. What a
 * curator actually wants on opening the admin is whether anything needs
 * attention: a trail with no line, one whose last save couldn't reach OSM, work
 * left in draft.
 *
 * **Never throws**, the same rule as `getCityTrails` and `getMapBrand`. A
 * dashboard is the first page after signing in, so an exception here is an
 * admin nobody can get into — over a decorative panel. Every count degrades to
 * null and the panel says so.
