/**
 * Mountain bike trails — the collection that currently lives as a ~3,200 line
 * array in src/data/mountain-bike-trails.data.ts.
 *
 * **By default a trail does not own its geometry.** It references the OSM ways
 * it rides on, and the line, distance, elevation, and bounds are rebuilt from
 * OSM on save by the `resolveTrailGeometry` hook. That is the path to prefer:
 * the geometry stays maintained upstream, where community fixes flow in for
 * free, and the derived numbers can't be edited into disagreeing with the line.
 *
 * When OSM is wrong or missing, the geometry editor lets a curator drag the
 * line into place. Doing so flips `geometrySource` to 'edited', which stops the
 * OSM rebuild for that trail — the line is then owned here, and only the
 * measurements are still derived. `distance` and the elevation fields stay
 * read-only either way; they are always computed from the line, never typed.
 *
 * The stored `geom` is plain JSON rather than a PostGIS column. See docs/adr/0001.
