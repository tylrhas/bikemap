/**
 * Trail conditions: `trail_condition_types` (the dropdown) and
 * `trail_conditions` (the reports).
 *
 * The SQL is exactly as Payload generated it, so a later `migrate:create` sees
 * no drift. Two things to know:
 *
 * - `trail_id` is NOT NULL with an ON DELETE SET NULL foreign key, so Postgres
 *   refuses to delete a trail that has reports. `Trails` has a `beforeDelete`
 *   hook that clears them first; a not-null violation here means it broke.
 * - The seed is a separate `db.execute`, like the rating/kind seed in the
 *   initial migration: `condition_id` is required, so no rows means no form.
