/**
 * The rating and kind vocabularies a trail is described with.
 *
 * Both used to be hardcoded `select` options on the Trails collection, which
 * meant adding a difficulty band or a new sort of trail was a code change, a
 * migration, and a deploy. They are collections now — `trail-ratings` and
 * `trail-kinds` — so a curator can add, rename, recolor, and reorder them.
 *
 * What stays in code is the *default* vocabulary and the small set of things a
 * database row genuinely can't carry:
 *
 * - **The seed rows.** A trail's rating is a required relationship, so an empty
 *   database would be one you couldn't create a trail in. The migration inserts
 *   these, and the seed scripts fall back to creating them.
 * - **The icons.** A FontAwesome `IconDefinition` is an object, not a value —
 *   it can't round-trip through Postgres. A kind stores an icon *key* and this
 *   maps it back, which also keeps the icon set to ones already bundled.
 * - **The fallbacks.** `getCityTrails` must never throw, so every derived value
 *   needs an answer even when the vocabulary rows are missing or a curator has
 *   left a color blank.
 *
 * Client-safe: no Node-only imports, so the sidebar can use it too.
