/**
 * Geometry is stored as plain JSON, not a PostGIS column.
 *
 * A trail here doesn't own its geometry — it references OSM ways by id, and the
 * line is rebuilt from OSM on save (see src/payload/osm). The stored GeoJSON is
 * a derived cache, so the database never needs to query or edit it, and the
 * spatial types would buy nothing. See docs/adr/0001.
